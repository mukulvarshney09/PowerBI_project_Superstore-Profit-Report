This is a PowerBI project using superstore sales data.

# Objective
The goal of this project is to effectively visualize profit data to identify trends, analyze profit distribution, and gain insights into product performance. I am analyzing profit distribution based on city, category, sub-category, segment, etc.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes sales and profit data of the superstore, encompassing parameters such as order date, ship date, customer name, segment, city, state, product ID, sub-category, quantity, and more. These parameters are valuable for analyzing sales trends and making future growth-oriented decisions.

## Conclusion
I structured the report to facilitate easy filtering of sales/profit data by city. Additionally, it allows analysis of sales by region, segment, category, and more.
